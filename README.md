# Text Mining, Classification, and Sentimental Analysis

Text mining is the process of analyzing and extracting valuable insights from text data. In Python, there are several libraries and tools available for performing text mining tasks, such as NLTK, TextBlob, spaCy, scikit-learn, and gensim.

Text classification and sentiment analysis involve a combination of NLP and data analysis techniques to analyze and categorize large volumes of text data. Following techniques are commonly used:

  1. Text preprocessing: This involves cleaning and transforming the raw text data to prepare it for analysis. Techniques such as tokenization (breaking text into words or phrases), stopword removal (removing common words that don't carry much meaning), and stemming (reducing words to their base form) can be used to simplify the text data.
  

  2. Feature extraction: This involves selecting the most important features (words or phrases) from the preprocessed text data that are likely to be relevant for classification. Techniques such as bag-of-words (counting the frequency of each word in a document), TF-IDF (weighing words by their importance in a document), and word embeddings (representing words as vectors in a high-dimensional space) can be used to extract features.
  
      In [Medium](https://medium.com/@eskandar.sahel/exploring-feature-extraction-techniques-for-natural-language-processing-46052ee6514) article, I explored several common techniques for feature extraction in NLP, including CountVectorizer, TF-IDF, word embeddings, bag of words, bag of n-grams, HashingVectorizer, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), t-SNE, and Part-of-Speach (POS) tagging. [Text_Feature_Extraction.ipynb](/Text-Mining-Classification-Analysis/Text_Feature_Extraction.ipynb) is a sample implemention of the feature extraction methods. 
      
  3. Machine learning algorithms: This involves training a machine learning model on the preprocessed and feature-extracted text data to predict the category or sentiment of new text data. Common machine learning algorithms used for text classification and sentiment analysis include Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forests, and Deep Learning models like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).This notebook will focus on text-classification and sentiment analysis. We will go through all major NLP and dat analysis techniques, some of which include:

  4. Evaluation metrics: This involves measuring the performance of the text classification and sentiment analysis models on a test dataset. Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrix can be used to evaluate the performance of the models.

  5. Model optimization: This involves fine-tuning the machine learning models to improve their performance on the test dataset. Techniques such as hyperparameter tuning (adjusting model parameters such as learning rate, regularization, etc.), feature selection (selecting the most important features for the model), and ensemble learning (combining multiple models to improve performance) can be used to optimize the models.
  
      [Sentimental Analysis Project](/Text-Mining-Classification-Analysis/text_classification_sentimental_analysis.ipynb) was a great example of how text classification and sentiment analysis can be used to extract valuable insights from large volumes of text data.
